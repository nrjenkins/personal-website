I am currently a graduate student in the [Political Science Department](https://politicalscience.ucr.edu) at the [University of California, Riverside](https://www.ucr.edu). Prior to attending UC Riverside, I completed a Master’s Degree in [Economics](http://www.cla.csulb.edu/departments/economics/) at [California State University, Long Beach](http://www.csulb.edu).

I am a political scientist interested in using and teaching quantitative research methods to solve complex social science and policy problems.
