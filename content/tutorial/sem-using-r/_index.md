## Discovering Structural Equation Moedling Using ~~Stata~~ R, the Tidyverse, and `Lavaan`

This project is a guide through Alan Acock's [Discovering Structural Equation Modeling Using Stata](https://www.stata.com/bookstore/discovering-structural-equation-modeling-using-stata/) in R using the [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org), and [`lavaan`](https://lavaan.ugent.be) packages. The data needed to replicate the analyses in the book can be found on the book's website here: [Discovering Structural Equation Modeling Using Stata](https://www.stata.com/bookstore/discovering-structural-equation-modeling-using-stata/). My goal is to show how to fit these models in R and visualize their results.

This project is published here: [https://discovering-sem-using-r.netlify.app](https://discovering-sem-using-r.netlify.app).
